    <div class="edu-title-medium">Network Technician</div>

    <p>
        Worked on the installation and configuration of network setups for a range of customers, mostly involving
        switches, routers, and access points in small to medium environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        A large part of the job revolved around building stable network layouts using VLANs, DHCP, and DNS, and then
        validating everything through on-site testing and troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <p>
        This included several longer projects where I had to adjust configurations based on feedback from clients and
        changing requirements in their infrastructure. Over time I became very familiar with diagnosing bottlenecks,
        isolating misconfigurations, and improving overall network performance. All installations were documented so they
        could be maintained or expanded later on.

    <div class="edu-title-medium">IT-Security Consultant</div>

    <p>
        Worked on securing and maintaining existing network environments while supporting clients during upgrades or
        structural changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        My day-to-day tasks involved monitoring performance, tracing issues in the network stack, and adjusting
        configurations to keep systems stable and secure.
    </p>

    <p>
        During this period I collaborated closely with internal IT teams when we had to redesign or improve parts of the
        infrastructure. I also spent time advising clients on practical security measures and ensuring that documentation
        matched compliance requirements and audit standards.
