    <div class="edu-title-medium">Network Technician</div>
    Worked on the installation and configuration of network setups for a range of customers, mostly involving switches, routers, and access points in small to medium environments.
    A large part of the job revolved around building stable network layouts using VLANs, DHCP, and DNS, and then validating everything through on-site testing and troubleshooting.

    This included several longer projects where I had to adjust configurations based on feedback from clients and changing requirements in their infrastructure. Over time I became very familiar with diagnosing bottlenecks, isolating misconfigurations, and improving overall network performance. All installations were documented so they could be maintained or expanded later on.

    <div class="edu-title-medium">IT-Security Consultant</div>
    Worked on securing and maintaining existing network environments while supporting clients during upgrades or structural changes.
    My day-to-day tasks involved monitoring performance, tracing issues in the network stack, and adjusting configurations to keep systems stable and secure.

    During this period I collaborated closely with internal IT teams when we had to redesign or improve parts of the infrastructure. I also spent time advising clients on practical security measures and ensuring that documentation matched compliance requirements and audit standards.
