    <div class="we-year">2018–2023</div>
    <br>
    Worked on the installation and configuration of network setups for a range of customers,
    mostly involving switches, routers, and access points in small to medium environments.
    <br><br>
    A large part of the job revolved around building stable network layouts using VLANs, DHCP, and DNS,
    followed by on-site validation through testing and troubleshooting.
    <br><br>
    This included several longer projects where I adjusted configurations based on client feedback
    and evolving infrastructure needs. Through this work I became familiar with diagnosing bottlenecks,
    isolating misconfigurations, and improving overall network performance.
    <br><br>
    All installations were documented thoroughly so they could be maintained or expanded later on.

    Worked on securing and maintaining existing network environments while supporting clients

    Documentation was maintained for compliance, audits, and long-term operational clarity.
