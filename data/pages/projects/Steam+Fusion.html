        This framework bridges Steam's social features with Photon Fusion 2's networking, allowing players to create lobbies through Steam, invite friends via the overlay, and seamlessly connect to Photon's servers.
        <br><br>
        The core challenge was synchronizing two fundamentally different systems. Steam lobbies are metadata containers whilst Photon handles actual gameplay networking. I implemented an event-driven architecture where Steam callbacks trigger Photon session creation, with the session name stored as Steam lobby metadata. When a friend accepts an invite, their client retrieves the Photon session name and automatically joins the correct room.
        <br><br>
        The section I'm most proud of is the avatar loading system. Steam provides profile images asynchronously, so I built a caching system with event callbacks that allows UI elements to subscribe to avatar load events. When an avatar finishes downloading, all relevant UI updates automatically without manual polling.
        <br><br>
        Testing required running multiple game instances simultaneously to verify invite flows and lobby synchronization across clients. The DontDestroyOnLoad persistence pattern created interesting challenges - UI elements survive scene transitions but references break, requiring dynamic re-wiring after each scene load.
        <br><br>
        Looking forward, I'd like to implement Steam's Rich Presence API and potentially add support for Steam's networking transport as a LAN alternative. The complete implementation includes managers for Steam initialization, lobby management, and Photon bridging, alongside UI systems for real-time player lists with avatar updates.
