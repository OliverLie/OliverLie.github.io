        PirateWars is a multiplayer FPS I developed to explore the technical challenges of networked physics on moving platforms. The core concept - battling on dynamic pirate ships - created interesting problems: how do you keep players synchronized when the ground beneath them is constantly moving and rotating?
        <br><br>
        I implemented Photon Fusion 2's server-authoritative networking with Host-Client architecture, where the host validates all damage, scoring, and win conditions to prevent cheating. The most challenging aspect was handling player movement on moving ships - players needed to inherit ship velocity whilst maintaining responsive FPS controls. I solved this by parenting the Kinematic Character Controller to the ship transform, which required careful handling of network synchronization and edge cases like players jumping between ships.
        <br><br>
        The game uses a Finite State Machine to manage match flow, from lobby to gameplay to results, with all state transitions validated server-side. I also implemented a comprehensive score synchronization system using Photon's NetworkDictionary to track player kills, deaths, and objective captures in real-time.
        <br><br>
        Developed in Unity using C#, Photon Fusion 2, Photon Advanced KCC, and custom FSM implementation.
